POC

1) Design and architecture of a solution
   First need to design the database structures like tables
   For example every employee needs some basic details for registration like name, mobile number, email id, address, technology


To design a table for employee registration that includes the basic details you mentioned (Name, Mobile No, Email id, Address, and Technology), you could create a table with the following columns:

Column Name	Data Type	                Description
employee_id	int	                Unique identifier for the employee
first_name	                varchar(50)	First name of the employee
last_name	                varchar(50)	Last name of the employee
mobile_no	                varchar(20)	Mobile number of the employee
email_id	                varchar(100)	Email address of the employee
address	                varchar(200)	Address of the employee
technology 	varchar(50)	Technology expertise of the employee

In this example, the employee_id column is a unique identifier that can be used to relate employee data to other tables in the database, such as an employee roles table or a department table. The first_name and last_name columns are used to store the employee's name, while the mobile_no, email_id, and address columns store their contact information.

The technology column can be used to store information about the employee's skills. Depending on the needs of the organization, additional columns could be added to store other information, such as the employee's job title or hire date.

Overall, this table provides a basic structure for storing employee registration information, which can be used as a starting point for more complex employee management systems.

CREATE TABLE employee_registration (
  employee_id int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  last_name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  mobile_no varchar(20) NOT NULL,
  email_id varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  address varchar(200) NOT NULL,
  technology varchar(50) NOT NULL
)

===========================================================================================

2) Azure services needed and why
   once employee is logged in then depending on the technology they need to get learning topics for example if employee belongs to .net 
   then he might having the learning skills like .net core, entity framefork, and so on
   For this purpose we need to azure services.


Based on the requirements you have described, the following Azure services may be useful:

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) - Azure AD is a cloud-based identity and access management service that enables secure and seamless access to various applications and resources. You can use Azure AD to authenticate and authorize users, and control access to the learning topics based on their roles and permissions.

Azure App Service - Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. You can use App Service to host your learning management system (LMS) and deliver the learning topics to your employees. With App Service, you can easily deploy and manage your LMS without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

Azure SQL Database - Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service that provides high availability, scalability, and security. You can use Azure SQL Database to store the learning topics and related data, such as employee progress and completion status. With Azure SQL Database, you can ensure data consistency and reliability, and easily scale as your data grows.

Azure Cognitive Search - Azure Cognitive Search is the only cloud search service with built-in AI capabilities that enrich all types of information to help you identify and explore relevant content at scale. Use cognitive skills for vision, language, and speech, or use custom machine learning models to uncover insights from all types of content. With Azure Cognitive Search, you can quickly and easily index the learning topics and provide fast and relevant search results to your employees. You can also use Azure Cognitive Search to provide personalized recommendations based on the employee's learning history and preferences.

Azure Notification Hubs - Azure Notification Hubs is a scalable and cross-platform push notification service that enables you to send push notifications to your employees. You can use Azure Notification Hubs to notify employees about new learning topics, remind them about incomplete courses, and provide updates on their progress. With Azure Notification Hubs, you can ensure that your employees stay engaged and motivated to learn.

These Azure services can help you build a robust learning management system that meets the needs of your employees. 
===============================================================================================

3) Bot 
    to fetch the data


In real life we have differnt ways to create Chat bot. I was trying with Visual studio 19(Python Development Environment) but was facing error because i need to clear ML and Chat bot deep concepts.
Here i am sharing with basic working of chatbot with Dictionary key values.
 
bot = {
    "Hii": "Hey",
    "how are you": "I am fine say you",
    "where are you working": "I am working in novacept",
    "where do you live": "i am living in Chandigarh"
}

while True:
    a=input()
    if (a=="quit"):
         break
    else:
        print(bot[a])
   



============================================================
4)Add on
  need to add more if the employees wants to upgrade themselves
  

If employees wants to upgrade themselves with the addition of more information about themselves.
Like in first Database table they have  name, mobile number, email id, address, technology. 
Now they want to add employee's job title information in column

Alter table employee_registration
add employee's job title varchar(100)


============================================================

5) Challenges 
   code should be reusable

I am facing issues while creating chatbot because my concepts are not clear currently.
with your Task I realised what i need to focus now.
Definately i will work on same

Thanks
